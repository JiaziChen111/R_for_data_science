# A Brief Introduction to This File
This R file walks through G. Grolemund & H. Wickhams’s online text, ["R for Data Science."](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) Much of the code is sourced directly from the book and credit belongs to the authors. Here, some sections of code are heavily commented so that the beginning R programmer can read through and understand what each line of code does and compare it to their own as they work through the text. Throughout, the book provides the primary and most thorough explanation. **For the greatest learning benefit, I suggest you attempt each exercise on your own before looking at the code or write-ups provided here.** Of course, there is more than one way to write code and you may find a more elegant solution that you prefer.   

For those new to R and RStudio, it may be of additional benefit to knit the document and examine how the code in the Rmd file is visually expressed in the resultant knitted document. For example, see how the ` ["R for Data Science."](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)` is expressed as a hyperlink in the preceeding paragraph where it was not surrounded by tick-marks and compare that to how the same text is expressed in this paragraph when surrounded by ticks. See also the difference in appearance when knitting to different document types (HTML, PDF, Word).  

**Tip**: *If you are using RStudio, click the text next to the orange # box at the bottom of the editor window to easily navigate the code chunks.*  

**Tip**: *Use the `?` before any command to view the documentation on that function. Do this often. For example, type `?setwd` to see a description, usage, arguments, and more for the function `setwd()`.*  

**Tip**: Find RStudio Cheatsheets at [https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls()) # Clear the workspace
setwd("~/Dropbox/code/R/R_for_data_science/") # Set the working directory

## Install and load required packages
list.of.packages <- c("knitr", "tidyverse", "nycflights13") # Make a character vector of packages used in the script
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])] # Which packages are not already installed
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages) 
lapply(list.of.packages, library, character.only = TRUE) # If the list of packages we want and the list of new packages is not of the same length, install the packages listed in new.packages

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figs_ch05/', echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE) # Set the knit options: save figures to a folder, echo code chunks in the knitted document, don't print warnings in the knitted doc, don't print messages in the knitted doc.
```

# Chapter 5, Data transformation
## Introduction 

```{r The data set}
?flights
flights
#View(flights) # This line is commented out because the View function will prevent the document from knitting
```

The six key `dplyr` functions:  

`filter()`  
`arrange()`  
`select()`  
`mutate()`  
`summarise()`  
`groupby()`  

## `filter()`
```{r Filter Jan 1st flights}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month ==12, day == 25))
```

### Comparisons  

Comparison operators:  

`>`  
`>=`  
`<`  
`<=`  
`!=`  
`==`  

```{r Operator error}
# filter(flights, month = 1) # wrong
filter(flights, month == 1) # corrected
```

```{r Floating point numbers}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1/49 * 49 == 1

near(sqrt(2) ^ 2, 2)
near(1/49 * 49, 1)
```

### Logical operators

![Boolean operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/transform-logical.png)  

```{r}
# Find all flights that departed in November or December
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))

# Find all flights that weren’t delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```

### Missing values  
```{r Exploring missing values}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
NA == NA
```

```{r Explicit NA example}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y

# We don't know!

is.na(x) # Is the value of x missing
```

### Exercises 5.2.4
#### 1. Find all flights that  

    1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours 
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.1}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```

    2. Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)  
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.2}
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
# or:
filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
```

    3. Were operated by United, American, or Delta  
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.3}
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "UA"))
filter(flights, carrier == "AA" | carrier == "UA")
```

    4. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)  
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.4}
filter(flights, month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
filter(flights, month == 7 | month == 8 | month == 9)
```

    5. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late  
```{r Exercise 5.3.4 1.5}
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay < 1)
```

    6. Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight  
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.6}
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay < -30)
```

    7. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 1.7}
filter(flights, dep_time > 0 & dep_time < 600)
```

#### 2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 2}
?between

# 1.5 simplified
filter(flights, between(flights$month, 7, 9))

# 1.7 simplified
filter(flights, between(flights$dep_time, 0, 600))
```

#### 3. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
```{r Exercise 5.2.4 3}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
# or
table(is.na(flights$dep_time))
```

#### 4. Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

- `NA^0` is not missing because any value to the 0th power is 1  
- `NA | TRUE` is not missing because the | operand will return `TRUE` as long as one condition is true. `TRUE` is `TRUE`.  
- FALSE & NA is not missng because the NA is ignored  
- In operations, any value interacting with an `NA` becomes missing. Missing values are ignored in conditional exressions.  

## `arrange()`
```{r Arrange}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```
```{r Descending order}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```
```{r Missing values}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
arrange(df, desc(x))
```

### Exercises 5.3.1
#### 1. How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na())`.
```{r Exercise 5.3.1 1}
# Example using arrival times
arrange(flights, !is.na(arr_time))
```

#### 2. Sort `flights` to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
```{r Exercise 5.3.1 2}
# Most delayed at departure
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))

# Left earliest
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```

### 3. Sort `flights` to find the fastest flights
```{r Exercise 5.3.1 3}
arrange(flights, desc(distance / air_time))
```

#### 4. Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?
```{r Exercise 5.3.1 4}
# Flights with the longest travel time
arrange(flights, desc(air_time))

# Flights with the shortest travel time
arrange(flights, air_time)
```

## `select()`
```{r Subsetting with select}
# Select columns by name
select(flights, year, month, day)

# Select all columns between year and day (inclusive)
select(flights, year:day)

# Select all columns except those from year to day
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

Helper functions to use with `select()`  

- `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with “abc”.
- `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with “xyz”.
- `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain “ijk”.
- `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You’ll learn more about regular expressions in strings.
- `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches x1, x2 and x3.

### `rename()`
```{r Rename}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

### `everything()`
```{r Everything}
# Move handful of variables to the start of the data frame
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
```

### Exercises 5.4.1
#### 1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.
```{r Exercise 5.4.1 1}
# select
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
# starts_with
select(flights, starts_with("dep_"), starts_with("arr_"))
# ends_with
select(flights, ends_with("time"), ends_with("delay"), -(starts_with("sched")), -(starts_with("air")))
# contains
select(flights, contains("dep"), contains("arr_"), -(contains("sched")))
```

#### 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a `select()` call?

The variable is included only once in the data frame
```{r Exercise 5.4.1 2}
select(flights, arr_delay, dep_delay, dep_delay)
```

#### 3. What does the `one_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

`one_of()` allows one to select variables that match those in a character vector. 

```{r Exercise 5.4.1 3}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, one_of(vars))
```

#### 4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

```
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

The `select()` helpers are not case sensitive by default and will select all variables that contain the character string `time` regardless of case (e.g. "TIME", "Time", time", "TiMe", etc.). To change the default, set `ignore.case = FALSE` within the helper function.
```{r Exercise 5.4.1 4}
# Default
select(flights, contains("TIME"))

# Set ignore.case = FALSE
select(flights, contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE))
```

## `mutate()`
```{r Use mutate}
# Create a narrower dataset
flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)

# Create new columns
mutate(flights_sml, 
       gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
       speed = distance / air_time * 60, 
       hours = air_time / 60, 
       gain_per_hour = gain / hours)
```
### `transmute()`

Only keep the new variables.  
```{r transmute}
transmute(flights,
            gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
            hours = air_time / 60, 
            gain_per_hour = gain / hours)
```

## Useful creation functions

1. Modular arithmatic, including:  

    - Division  
```{r Division}
100 / 3
```

    - Integer division  
```{r Integer division}
100 %/% 3
```

    - Remainder division  
```{r Remainder division}
100 %% 3
```
```{r Breaking up integers}
# Breaking up is(n't) hard to do
transmute(flights,
          dep_time,
          hour = dep_time %/%100,
          minute = dep_time %% 100)
```

2. logs
3.  Offsets (lead & lag)
```{r lead and lag}
(x <-  1:10)
lag(x)
lead(x)
```

4. Cumulative and rolling aggregates  
    - `cumsum()`  
    - `cumprod()`  
    - `cummin()`  
    - `cummax()`
    - `cummean()`
```{r Cumulative}
x
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```

5. Logical comparisons
6. Ranking
```{r Ranking}
(y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4))
min_rank(y) # Default: smallest values get small ranks
min_rank(desc(y)) # Give the largest values the smallest ranks
row_number(y)
dense_rank(y)
percent_rank(y)
cume_dist(y)
```

### Exercises 5.5.2
#### 1. Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.

#### 2. Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

#### 3. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

#### 4. Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().

#### 5. What does 1:3 + 1:10 return? Why?

#### 6. What trigonometric functions does R provide?
