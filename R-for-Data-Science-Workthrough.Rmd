# A Brief Introduction to This File
This R file walks through G. Grolemund & H. Wickhams’s online text, ["R for Data Science."](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) Much of the code is sourced directly from the book and credit belongs to the authors. Here, some sections of code are heavily commented so that the beginning R programmer can read through and understand what each line of code does and compare it to their own as they work through the text. Throughout, the book provides the primary and most thorough explanation. **For the greatest learning benefit, I suggest you attempt each exercise on your own before looking at the code or write-ups provided here.** Of course, there is more than one way to write code and you may find a more elegant solution that you prefer.   

For those new to R and RStudio, it may be of additional benefit to knit the document and examine how the code in the Rmd file is visually expressed in the resultant knitted document. For example, see how the ` ["R for Data Science."](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)` is expressed as a hyperlink in the preceeding paragraph where it was not surrounded by tick-marks and compare that to how the same text is expressed in this paragraph when surrounded by ticks. See also the difference in appearance when knitting to different document types (HTML, PDF, Word).  

**Tip**: *If you are using RStudio, click the text next to the orange # box at the bottom of the editor window to easily navigate the code chunks.*  

**Tip**: *Use the `?` before any command to view the documentation on that function. Do this often. For example, type `?setwd` to see a description, usage, arguments, and more for the function `setwd()`.* 
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls()) # Clear the workspace
setwd("~/Dropbox/R_projects/R_practice/") # Set the working directory

## Install and load required packages
list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "knitr") # Make a character vector of packages used in the script
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])] # Which packages are not already installed
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages) 
lapply(list.of.packages, library, character.only = TRUE) # If the list of packages we want and the list of new packages is not of the same length, install the packages listed in new.packages

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figs/', echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE) # Set the knit options: save figures to a folder, echo code chunks in the knitted document, don't print warnings in the knitted doc, don't print messages in the knitted doc.
```

# Begin Work-through
## Chapter 3, Data Visualisation
To really understand ggplot2, I highly recommend reading [“The Layered Grammar of Graphics”](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) as suggested at the beginning of Chapter 3. 

### The `mpg` data frame

```{r Examine the mpg data frame}
str(mpg) # Look at the structure of the mpg data frame
mpg # Look at the first 10 rows of the mpg data frame
```

Hypothesis: There is a negative linear relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency, such that as engine size increases fuel efficiency decreases.  

```{r Creating the ggplot}
ggplot(data=mpg) + # specify data frame 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) # specify that plot is a scatterplot with displ on the x axis and hwy on the y axis
```

The plot confirms the hypothesis that there is a negative relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency.  

### Template for making graphs with ggplot2
```{r Template, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

### Exercises 3.2.4

1. There are no visible results from the code below.  
```{r Exercises 3.2.4 1}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

2. Based on the output from `str(mpg)`, we see that there are 234 rows and 11 columns in the mpg data frame.  
```{r Exercises 3.2.4 2}
# Alternative means of finding number of rows and columns
nrow(mpg) # Pring the number of rows 
ncol(mpg)
```
There are `r nrow(mpg)` rows and `r ncol(mpg)` columns in the mpg data frame.   

3. The `drv` variable describes whether the vehicle is front, rear, or 4-wheel drive.  
```{r Exercises 3.2.4 3}
?mpg
```

4. The plot is not useful because the variables are categorical and multiple points are plotted atop one another. We are unable to determine from this plot how many observations there are of each class-drive combination.  
```{r Exercises 3.2.4 4}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x=class, y=drv))
```

### Aesthetic mappings
Test the hypothesis that the cars highlighted in red are hybrids by mapping car class to an aesthetic.  
```{r Map class to the color aesthetic}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) # map class to the color aesthetic so that three variables are now distinguishable in the plot: engine displacement on the x axis, highway miles per gallon on the y axis, and car class by color.
```

```{r Map class to the size aesthetic}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

```{r Map class to the alpha aesthetic}
# Left
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

# Right
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

```{r Set the aesthetic for blue points}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") # Set the aesthetic outside of aes() to manually assign it to all points
```

### Exercises 3.3.1

1. The points are not blue because the color aesthetic is set inside `aes()`.
```{r Exercises 3.3.1 1}
# Problematic code
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")) 

# Corrected code
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

```

2. To determine what the categorical and continuous variables are, one can either view the tibble by typing `mpg` or by viewing the documentation `?mpg`. One may decide whether a variable is categorical or continuous by checking whether it is stored as a character, integer, or double (floating point integer) value. However, this can lead to miscategorization in some cases. For example, while year is an integer, it is typically considered a whole number, a discrete variable without a meaningful 0 value anchor, and therefore not continuous. 

The categorical variables are:  

- model
- year (discrete, rather than categorical)
- trans
- drv
- fl
- class

The continuous variables are:

- displ
- cyl
- cty
- hwy
- year (in this data set, year is treated as an integer variable. Better to consider this "quantitative", rather than "continuous")

3. A continuous variable cannot be mapped to shape. When mapped to size or color, the continuous variable is binned by equal intervals (in this case, intervals of 5 mpg). When mapped to the size aesthetic, points scale by the intervals. Continuous variables when mapped to a color aesthetic are mapped along a gradient scale.  
```{r Exercises 3.3.1 3 shape, eval=FALSE}
# Mapping a continuous variable to the shape aesthetic
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))
```
```{r Exercises 3.3.1 3}
# Mapping continuous variables to the color and size aesthetics
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl, size = cty))

# Mapping categorical variables to size, color, and shape
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = model, color = class, shape = drv))
```

4. When the same variable is mapped to multiple aesthetics, it is represented by those aesthetics.  
```{r Exercises 3.3.1 4}
# Mapping the same variable to multiple aesthetics
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = cty)) # Here, city is mapped to the size and color aesthetics
```

5. According to the R documentation:  
"For shapes that have a border (like 21), you can colour the inside and  outside separately. Use the **stroke** aesthetic to modify the width of the border."  

**Tip**: [You can find documentation of available colors here.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)

```{r Exercises 3.3.1 5}
?geom_point

# Example using `stroke`
ggplot(data=mpg)+
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy), shape = 21, colour = "darkgreen", fill = "gold", size = 5, stroke = 5) # `size` sets the area of the inside (gold) and `stroke` sets the area of the outline (green)

# Just for fun, let's write short-hand code make the same plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "darkgreen", fill = "gold", size = 5, stroke = 5)
```

6. Setting the color aesthetic to `displ < 5` will assign one color to all x-axis (hwy) values < 5 and a different color to x-axis values $\ge$ 5. Since the color palette is not specified, default colors are used.  
```{r Exercises 3.3.1 6}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
```
