```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls()) # Clear the workspace
setwd("~/Dropbox/R_projects/practice/") # Set the working directory

## Install and load required packages
list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])] 
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages) 
lapply(list.of.packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

# Set the knit options: save figures to a folder, don't echo code chunks, don't print warnings, don't print messages.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figs/', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
